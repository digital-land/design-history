Digital Land has begun working with another DLUHC service team who's objective is to [reduce invalid planning applications](https://www.ripa.digital/) ([RIPA](https://www.ripa.digital/)).

The RIPA team needs machine readable data about planning and housing to build their service. Without it, they will have an incredibly difficult time helping people (their users) to answer key questions about their planning application.
