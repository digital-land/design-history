## What did we do?

There are a lot of inconsistencies with the data we collect from local planning authorities (LPAs). 

So we wanted to see whether providing feedback about their data would help those users.

## What did we learn?

### Users did not engage with strict validation errors

Initial versions of this prototype *validated* the the user's data against the standard and then presented the user with a report of all the errors and omissions. Users did not respond well to this type of feedback, especially users who were not data experts.

### Users respond well when their data is 'played back' to them.

Showing users their data in an easily digestible way prompted a much more positive response. Presenting facts and information that we had extrapolated from their data, triggered users to want to investigate omissions and inaccuracies.
