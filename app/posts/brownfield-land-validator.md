## What problem did we want to solve?

There are a lot of inconsistencies with the data we were collecting from LPAs. 

## What did we do?

We wanted to see whether providing feedback would help users.

In this first iteration we based the feedback on very strict validation. Unsurprisingly it didnâ€™t test well.
