## What did we do?

There are a lot of inconsistencies with the data we collect from local planning authorities (LPAs). 

So we wanted to see whether providing feedback about their data would help those users.

## What did we learn?

We learned:

* Users did not engage with strict validation errors when their data was checked against the standard.
* Users respond well when their data is 'played back' to them. Showing their data and presenting facts and information we gleaned from it, resulted in a better more proactive reponse from users.
