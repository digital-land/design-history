When designing and building a service, it can be easy to forget why previous decisions were made, even more so as new people join the team and others leave. A design history can help by creating a permanent record.

A design history site such as this one, is like a blog, with posts describing the development of new features, iterations of existing ones or findings from user research â€“ anything that may be useful to return to later.

This project was developed by the Becoming a teacher team at the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) who found that by keeping a design history, they could:

* re-evaluate decisions
* see how a feature changed over time
* see how things tested in research
* give context to new team members
* demonstrate reasons why certain features did not work
* create snapshots of how things looked at significant milestones
* share design decisions across government
* share everything with service assessors

You can read more or start your own design history with advice and code from their excellent [design history project site](https://design-history.herokuapp.com/).

**Some real examples of design histories are:**

* [Apply for teacher training: Reasons for withdrawing an application](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/reason-for-withdraw/)
* [Manage teacher applications: Deferring an application](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/deferring-applications-to-the-next-cycle/)
* [Find postgraduate teacher training: A snapshot of the service](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/find-teacher-training/find-december-2019/)
