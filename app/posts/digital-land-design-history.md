When designing and building a service, it can be easy to forget why previous decisions were made, even more so as new people join the team and others leave. A design history can help by creating a permanent record.

A design history site such as this one, is like a blog, with posts describing the development of new features, iterations of existing ones or findings from user research â€“ anything that may be useful to return to later.

Teams have found that by keeping a design history, they could:

* re-evaluate decisions
* see how a feature changed over time
* see how things tested in research
* give context to new team members
* demonstrate reasons why certain features did not work
* create snapshots of how things looked at significant milestones
* share design decisions across government
* share everything with service assessors

If you have any questions or comments for the digital land team you can email the team [digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk](mailto:digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk) or ind us on the cross government slack.
